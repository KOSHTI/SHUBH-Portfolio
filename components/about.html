                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <p>I am a passionate Software Developer with a strong foundation in Artificial Intelligence, specializing in solving real-world problems using technologies like Python, .NET, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. My journey began with a Bachelor's in Artificial Intelligence from G H Raisoni College of Engineering and Management, Pune, where I honed my skills in cutting-edge technologies such as Computer Vision. In my academic projects, I developed advanced systems such as the early Parkinson’s disease prediction model using deep learning, achieving 97.8% accuracy with CNNs to detect Parkinson’s from MRI scans.</p>
                <p>In my professional career, I have worked with innovative companies like e-Beta Innovations LLP, where I developed secure platforms using Django, Flask, and databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL. I also contributed to the Onscreen Exam Evaluation System project at KCES's IMR InfoTech, designing a hybrid desktop application with secure backend integration, using Python and .NET technologies for efficient exam evaluation.</p>
                <p>Currently, I am fully focused on the Onscreen Exam Evaluation System project at IMR InfoTech, where I'm developing a robust .NET application. As part of this project, I'm also implementing encryption and decryption to ensure the secure handling of sensitive exam data, adding an extra layer of security to the entire system.</p>
